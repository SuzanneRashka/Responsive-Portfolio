        <p>Experienced Support Representative adept at providing excellent customer service. I am a critical thinker with creative
            problem-solving skills, who exceeds performance standards. Eight years of military service and support allows
            me to be level-headed and calm in stressful situations with well-developed people skills.</p>
        <p>I enjoy working in diverse environments that challenge me on a daily basis. The work I've done with GXM Consulting
            was beyond rewarding, working on various platforms for the soldiers in Afghanistan. This was where I became bitten
            by the development bug and wanted to learn all I could. I have graduated the Full Stack Web Development at Galvanize
            where I learned Javascript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Express.js. We also completed projects using
            Angular, Ruby, and PHP.
            <p>I am currently attending the UT Austin Bootcamp Full Stack Web Development course, gaining more knowledge about
                this in-depth field. </p>
